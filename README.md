# Guitar Slammer Jammers

Guitar Slammer Jammers is a mix between *UmJammer Lammy* and *Friday Night Funkin'*. It is written in Haxe wth OpenFL/Lime and HaxeFlixel, which is powerd by OpenFL/Lime

## Build
My favorite build type is ```hl```, so after installing the required deps, run:
```bash
    # The hl option defaults to <host-platform> -hl
    lime test/build hl
    # You can replace it with
    openfl test/build hl
```
Or add the ```-hl``` option to the
```bash
    lime/openfl test/build macos/windows/linux
```
command
